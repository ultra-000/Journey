# Journey is a website about me :)

OK people **_nothing_** special here, this is just a simple project
to measure the progress I made through the past year (i.e. 2024 at the time of writing)
so you probably **wouldn't** be interested, if you wanna stick though here are the links:

1. [Journey - English](<!-- blank for now -->)
2. [Journey - Arabic](<!-- blank for now -->)

**Note: the `src` folder is mostly for CSS now**
